1. All the [libraries](https://github.com/UCP-Internship/codemerge/tree/master/libraries) are included in the project. To install them, compress the files to a .zip format and simply add them via the arduino app.

2. You can find the code for each individual sensors [here](https://github.com/UCP-Internship/codemerge/tree/master/Sensors_only), or the code for some combinations between different sensors [here](https://github.com/UCP-Internship/codemerge/tree/master/Complete_codes).

3. Codes for the SD card shield can be found [here](https://github.com/UCP-Internship/codemerge/tree/master/SD_card_programs) and codes for the Wifi shield can be found [here](https://github.com/UCP-Internship/codemerge/tree/master/WiFi).

4. The whole functionning code to count people and get some informations about the climate and upload it on the [openSensmap](https://opensensemap.org/) can be found [here](https://github.com/UCP-Internship/codemerge/tree/master/Complete_codes/Sensebox_code_door) and [here](https://github.com/UCP-Internship/codemerge/tree/master/Complete_codes/Sensebox_code_elevator).
